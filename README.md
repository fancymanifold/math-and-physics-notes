# Math and physics notes

My personal brief notes on various topics from *mathematics* and *theoretical physics*. Currently only containing notes on mathematics of the Standard Model of particle physics (*hopefully* other notes will be added in the future). All notes are handwritten and packaged as `.pdf` files.


## Symmetry and the Standard Model

[These]("Stadard&#32;Model/Standard&#32;Model.pdf") are my notes from the first part of the book [*Symmetry and the Standard Model*](https://www.amazon.com/Symmetry-Standard-Model-Mathematics-Particle/dp/1441982663) by M.Robinson (with a couple of paragraphs from [*Physics from Symmetry*](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Symmetry-Undergraduate-Lecture-Notes/dp/3319666304) by J.Schwichtenberg).
